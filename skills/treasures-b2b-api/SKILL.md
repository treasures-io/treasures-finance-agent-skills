# Treasures B2B API — Agent Skill

Guide for AI agents (and any non-human caller) using the Treasures public B2B API to discover tokenized stocks, quote + execute trades, bridge USDC across chains, and read portfolio + trade history on behalf of a single end-user wallet pair.

- **Base URL:** `https://api.treasures.io/public/v1`
- **Network:** trades execute against **Ethereum mainnet + Solana mainnet-beta — real funds, not a testnet**. Point your own RPCs at mainnet; the token/contract addresses in this skill are mainnet.
- **Required headers:** set `Content-Type: application/json` on every request carrying a body — a body sent with a **non-JSON** content-type (e.g. `text/plain`, which some HTTP clients default to when you don't set headers) fails `415` before any schema check. Also send `X-Treasures-Skill: treasures-b2b-api` and `X-Treasures-Skill-Version: 1.1.0` (this skill's `metadata.version`): today they're informational (the fund-moving endpoints echo `X-Treasures-Api-Revision` + `X-Min-Skill-Version` back), but once the API floor rises, an enrolled caller below it gets a clean `426 skill_version_unsupported` with upgrade instructions — plus `Deprecation`/`Sunset` warning headers during the grace window — instead of a silent break. Omitting the version header opts out of that early warning.
- **Wire format:** all token amounts, USDC, shares, prices, and bps-derived decimals are **strings** (avoid JS float drift). Integer fields (`expires_at`, `*_bps`, `quote_index`) are JSON numbers. Never round-trip a money value through JS `number`.

This entry doc is the map + the footguns. **It is not enough on its own to execute a trade** — full schemas, signing code, and error tables live in the references below. **Load the reference for the task before you act; you don't need to read them all.**

> **Schema-of-record:** an OpenAPI spec (`openapi.yaml`) is published alongside this skill in the same repository. This skill is self-sufficient for normal use — consult the spec only for exhaustive field-level validation or client codegen; you don't need to read it to operate.

## TL;DR — happy path

```
1. GET   /stocks/tickers              → supported tickers + token addresses
2. GET   /stocks/prices?tickers=AAPL  → live price snapshot
3. ONE-TIME: set ERC-20 allowances on Ethereum (see traps below)  ← CRITICAL
4. POST  /quote/buy   (or /sell)      → quote(s) + signable payload(s)
5. Sign each signable_payload with the matching wallet key
6. POST  /trade/submit                → broadcast
7. GET   /quote/{quote_id}/status     → poll until terminal
8. GET   /portfolio                   → reconciled holdings
```

Need cross-chain USDC first? Insert a bridge between steps 2 and 4: `POST /bridge/quote` → sign + broadcast it yourself → `GET /bridge/{id}/status` until `completed` or `failed`. See [`references/bridging.md`](references/bridging.md).

## Before your first call — pre-flight traps

These cause silent or first-time-only failures. Handle them up front.

**1. Ethereum ERC-20 approvals are required before any transfer.** The API does **not** broadcast approvals for you; set them once per `(token, spender)` from the user's wallet, or your first Eth sell/bridge fails (`not_enough_balance_or_allowance` / silent forever-pending bridge). Solana has no allowances — skip on `sol` legs.

| Flow                    | Approve                                                         | Spender                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eth buy (USDC → stock)  | USDC `0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48`               | settlement `0x111111125421ca6dc452d289314280a0f8842a65`                                 |
| Eth sell (stock → USDC) | each protocol's stock token (per ticker — a sell may span both) | settlement (same)                                                                       |
| `eth → sol` bridge      | USDC                                                            | `signable_payload.approval_spender` from the bridge quote (non-null on the normal flow) |

Set `allowance = max-uint256` once. Approve code + the `approval_spender` null/non-null rule: [`references/trading.md`](references/trading.md#first-time-approvals).

**2. Hold the input token on the chain you trade.** A buy spends **USDC on the chosen chain**; a sell spends the **stock token**. The server pre-checks _sell_ holdings (insufficient → `422 holdings_insufficient` at quote time) but does **NOT** pre-check _buy_ USDC — an underfunded buy passes `/quote/buy` **and** `/trade/submit`, then the on-chain swap fails at the end (`broadcast_failed` / `not_enough_balance_or_allowance`), wasting the whole flow. **Verify USDC before quoting**: read the wallet, or call `GET /portfolio` (`usdc.{sol, eth}`). Need USDC on the other chain? Bridge first.

**3. Native gas: Treasures does not subsidize it.** Any operation your key broadcasts needs native balance on that chain. Eth buys/sells are gasless (the execution venue pays), but approvals + bridge broadcasts cost ETH; all Solana txs cost SOL. Keep ≥ **0.02 SOL** and ≥ **0.01 ETH** floats. Detail: [`references/errors.md`](references/errors.md#gas).

**4. The EVM bridge tx ships with `nonce=0`.** You MUST inject the wallet's real nonce before signing or broadcast is rejected ("nonce too low"). Most common bridge footgun — see [`references/bridging.md`](references/bridging.md#evm-sign-broadcast).

**5. Solana ownership proof is base64, NOT base58.** Privy/Turnkey quickstarts show base58 (`bs58.encode`) — that's the #1 cause of `ownership_proof_sol_invalid`. See [`references/auth.md`](references/auth.md#embedded-wallets).

**6. `chain:"robinhood"` is a different contract — YOU broadcast, and YOU pay gas.** The opt-in Robinhood Chain venue (Robinhood Stock Tokens, chain id **4663**, priced in **USDG**, settled by an on-chain swap on 4663) does **not** follow the sign-only model the sol/eth legs use. `/quote/buy` **or `/quote/sell`** with `chain:"robinhood"` returns **raw EVM transactions** — an `approve` (when your allowance is short; on a buy the approve is on USDG, on a sell it is on the Stock Token) then the `swap`; you set the nonce, sign, and **broadcast both yourself on chain 4663, paying native ETH gas**, then report the swap hash to `/trade/submit` as `{ type:"evm_broadcast_tx", tx_hash }` (exactly one — the swap hash, not the approve). You need your own 4663 RPC + native ETH; a wallet holding only Stock Tokens can't trade (fund gas first). Amounts are USDG — read `base_asset` + `amount_base`, not the `_usdc`-named fields. Sell **is** supported (chain-pinned, token → USDG; the server sizes the exit against your 4663 balance). **Because you broadcast, this venue is never reconciled server-side** — you must **report** every swap (`/trade/submit`) or it never enters `/trades` at all (no reconciler backfills it), then **poll `/status` to `completed`** or it stays `broadcast` and counts toward no P&L; the 4663 balance shows on `/portfolio` regardless. Full flow: [`references/trading.md`](references/trading.md#robinhood).

## Auth essentials

Three endpoints require an `ownership_proof`: `POST /quote/buy`, `POST /quote/sell`, and `POST /bridge/quote` (**both** `sol_signature` + `eth_signature` mandatory on bridge — it spans both chains). Everything else is unauthenticated; `/trade/submit` is gated by the per-leg signed payload itself.

Sign this exact UTF-8 byte string (lines joined with `\n`) with each wallet's key:

```
treasures-finance-quote-v1
{issued_at}
{sol_wallet|""}
{eth_wallet|""}
```

- `eth_wallet` **must be lowercased** in the challenge. Empty string (not `null`/omitted) for a side you didn't supply. No extra fields — schema is `.strict()`.
- `sol_signature`: **base64** raw Ed25519 over the challenge bytes. `eth_signature`: `0x` 65-byte **EIP-191 `personal_sign`** (not EIP-712).
- **Validity:** `issued_at` is unix seconds; accepted in `[now − 300s, now + 30s]`, else `401 ownership_proof_skewed`. One proof is reusable within that window (no nonce store) — a both-wallets proof works on all three endpoints; a single-wallet proof on `/quote/*` only (bridge needs both signatures).

Signing code, all-or-nothing per-proof rules, embedded-wallet troubleshooting, and deterministic test vectors: [`references/auth.md`](references/auth.md).

## Critical contracts — read before trading

- **`broadcast_unknown` → do NOT retry.** Lost upstream response; the order may have landed. Poll `/quote/{id}/status` (or `/trades`) to confirm on-chain outcome before re-quoting. Retrying risks a double-fill.
- **Slippage bounds:** `max_slippage_bps` ∈ `[10, 5000]` for `/quote/*`, `[10, 500]` for `/bridge/*`. Out of range → `400 invalid_slippage` (response echoes the cap).
- **Quote TTLs are tight** (~25–55s for trades, ~30s bridge). If sign+submit takes longer than `expires_at − 5s`, expect `410 quote_stale` — re-quote.
- **Buy = pick ONE `quote_index`; sell = submit ALL of them.** Buy with >1 leg → `400 quote_index_mismatch`; sell subset → `400 incomplete_submit`.
- **Must-handle errors** (full matrix + backoff policy in [`references/errors.md`](references/errors.md)):

## Version & compatibility

Sending your skill version opts you into a version gate: deprecation warnings while it
ages, then a hard stop once stale. Route **every** call through one helper that attaches it:

```ts
const SKILL_VERSION = '1.1.0'; // = SKILL.md metadata.version

// Route EVERY Treasures API call through this — don't call fetch() directly. It attaches the
// skill version and applies the gate to every response: 426 hard-stops, deprecation warns.
async function apiFetch(url: string, init: RequestInit = {}): Promise<Response> {
  const res = await fetch(url, {
    ...init,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'X-Treasures-Skill': 'treasures-b2b-api',
      'X-Treasures-Skill-Version': SKILL_VERSION,
      ...init.headers,
    },
  });
  if (res.status === 426) {                                 // blocking — skill too old
    const body = await res.json().catch(() => ({}));        // {error, min_skill_version, api_revision, upgrade}
    throw { status: 426, ...body };                         // STOP: relay body.upgrade, do NOT retry or trade
  }
  const sunset = res.headers.get('Sunset'), warning = res.headers.get('Warning');   // non-blocking — aging skill (finish, then warn user)
  if (res.headers.get('Deprecation') || sunset || warning)
    console.warn(`skill deprecated — sunset ${sunset ?? '?'}; update: ${res.headers.get('Link') ?? 'see SKILL.md'}${warning ? ` — ${warning}` : ''}`);
  return res;
}
```

- **`Deprecation` / `Sunset` / `Warning` response headers → non-blocking.** Finish the
  current operation, then tell the user this skill is deprecated, the `Sunset` date,
  and to update (use the `Link` URL).
- **`426 skill_version_unsupported` → blocking.** The server fails closed **before**
  any fund move. Do **not** submit or retry — surface the response's `upgrade` command
  and stop.
- **Standard-versioning signals → treat as possible staleness.** A `Sunset` on the
  versioned path, an unexpected `410`/`404` on a documented endpoint, or a new
  `400 invalid_request` on a body that used to validate → stop and check for a skill
  update; don't blindly retry.
