# Treasures Wallet

Drive a Treasures **delegated** wallet over HTTP. The wallet is **non-custodial** — it stays the
user's. Treasures holds the **swap signer** as a delegated signer, **scoped strictly to trading
tokenized real-world assets**, and executes on-chain; the agent only submits **intents** with a
scoped API key. ⇒ No web3 libs, no keys, no RPC.

## When to use

- Buy/sell tokenized equities (e.g. NVDA, TSLA) as **xStocks** or **Ondo** tokens vs **USDC** on
  Solana or Ethereum, from a Treasures wallet.
- Preview a trade price (quote), check a wallet's balances/positions, or read its trade history / P&L.
- Onboard an agent: provision a wallet + mint a scoped (`trade`/`quote`) API key with optional caps.
- Manage API keys for a wallet (owner-side: create / list / revoke).

Do **not** use for: generic Solana/EVM RPC work, non-Treasures wallets, or anything requiring the
agent to hold a private key — the whole point of this design is that it doesn't.

## Mental model (read this — most of it is non-obvious)

- **Delegated signing, not custody. The agent never signs.** The wallet is non-custodial; the agent
  POSTs intents and Treasures holds the **swap signer** — authorized only for tokenized-RWA trades —
  and executes. The skill needs only HTTPS + the API key.
- **TWO base paths** (this is the #1 gotcha), both off the host `https://api.treasures.io`:
  - **`API = {host}/api`** — wallet plane + onboarding (`/api/wallets/...`, `/api/onboarding-sessions/...`).
  - **`READS = {host}/public/v1`** — address-scoped reads only (`/public/v1/trades`, `/public/v1/portfolio`).
- **Two identifier types:**
  - `wallet_id` (`wlt_…`) → wallet-scoped endpoints (`API/wallets/:id/...`).
  - sol + eth **addresses** → address-scoped reads (`READS/trades`, `READS/portfolio`). Resolve them
    once from `GET API/wallets/:id` (`addresses.{solana,evm}`) and cache.
- **Auth is split:**
  - **Writes + quotes + trade-status poll** require `X-API-Key: twk_…` (scopes `quote` / `trade`,
    optional caps). The poll (`GET /wallets/:id/trades/:job_id`) takes the **same `trade` key** as the
    `POST` that created the job — it exposes the trade intent + outcome, so it is not keyless.
  - **Reads** (balances, history, portfolio, `GET /wallets/:id`, delegation state) need **no key** —
    public + IP-rate-limited, scoped by the address/id in the request.
- **Chain/protocol naming maps between layers:** balances/positions report `chain: "sol"|"eth"` and
  `issuer: "ondo"|"xstocks"`; quote/trade params take `chain: "solana"|"ethereum"` and
  `protocol: "ondo"|"xstocks"`. **Map `sol→solana`, `eth→ethereum`** when feeding a held position
  back into a quote/trade. (Responses echo `solana`/`ethereum`.)
- **Amounts are atomic integer strings — never JS `number`.** USDC = 6 dp. Stock tokens vary
  (reads expose both `shares` (human) and `raw_token` (on-chain)). Parse with a big-decimal lib.
- **Trading is async + route-first.** `POST /trades` → **202 + job**, then **poll** to terminal.
  Routing runs *before* the 202, so no-route / cap breach / unwhitelisted come back **synchronously**
  as 4xx (no job row).
- **Auto-routing is SINGLE-CELL.** Omit `chain`/`protocol` and Treasures picks the *one* best cell by
  net deliverable across `{solana,ethereum} × {ondo,xstocks}`. It does **not** split one trade across
  cells. (For sells larger than any single cell holds, see the **Sell playbook** — split client-side.)

## Config (the agent supplies)

| Key | Example | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `https://api.treasures.io` | default; override via `TREASURES_HOST` env |
| `api_key` | `twk_…` | onboarding (returned **once** — store in secret/env, never log/inline) |
| `wallet_id` | `wlt_XD825…` | onboarding poll (`response.wallet.wallet_id`) |
| `sol_address`, `eth_address` | `3HW73Fk…`, `0xaF51…` | onboarding poll (`response.wallet.addresses.{solana,evm}`); cache. Fallback if you only have a `wallet_id`: `GET API/wallets/:id` → `addresses` |

Derived: `API = https://api.treasures.io/api`, `READS = https://api.treasures.io/public/v1`
(generally `API = ${host}/api`, `READS = ${host}/public/v1`).

## Credential store — named profiles (multi-wallet)

An agent can hold **multiple Treasures wallets**, each a named **profile**. A name is a **client-side
label only** — Treasures has no wallet-name field (the canonical id is `wallet_id`), so the name lives
only in this store. The `api_key` is the only **secret** (`host`/`wallet_id`/addresses are not).

**File schema** — `${TREASURES_CONFIG:-~/.config/treasures/credentials.json}`, **`chmod 600`**:
```json
{
  "default": "trading",
  "wallets": {
    "trading":  { "api_key": "twk_…", "wallet_id": "wlt_…", "sol_address": "…", "evm_address": "0x…" },
    "treasury": { "api_key": "twk_…", "wallet_id": "wlt_…", "sol_address": "…", "evm_address": "0x…" }
  }
}
```
`host` is optional per profile — **omit to use the default** (`https://api.treasures.io`); set it only
to pin a profile to a different host.

**Resolve (every session, read in precedence):**
1. **Env vars** (a single profile named `env`): `TREASURES_API_KEY`, `TREASURES_WALLET_ID`, optional
   `TREASURES_HOST` (defaults to `https://api.treasures.io`),
   `TREASURES_SOL_ADDRESS`/`TREASURES_EVM_ADDRESS`. (Secret manager / CI.)
2. **Config file** above — the named `wallets` map + a `default` name.

**Select which wallet to act on (per request):**
- The user named one ("…in **treasury**") → use it (unknown name → list the available names, ask again).
- Else exactly one profile exists → use it.
- Else a `default` is set → use it **and say which one** you're acting on.
- Else (multiple, none specified, no default) → **ask the user which wallet**, listing names + addresses
  (offer a quick `/balances` per wallet if it helps them choose).

**Add a wallet** (after onboarding `poll`, or a pasted `api_key` + `wallet_id`):
- **Ask the user to name it** (suggest a default — the `owner_email` local-part or `wallet-N`). Names are
  unique; on collision, confirm overwrite or pick another. The **first** wallet added becomes `default`.
- The `api_key` is delivered **once** → write the profile **atomically in the same turn**, read it back to
  confirm. Prefer a runtime **secret store** for the `api_key` if one exists; **never** commit/log it.

**"Has a wallet"** ⇔ at least one profile resolves with `api_key` + `wallet_id`; none → **onboard**.
Reads-only (balances/history/portfolio) need just a profile's `wallet_id`/addresses, not the key.

## Step 0 — Preflight (BLOCKING)

Before any quote/trade, **resolve credentials via the Credential store above** (env → file). **Do not skip.**
- **`host`** is `https://api.treasures.io` — use it; don't ask. (Only deviate if a profile or
  `TREASURES_HOST` pins a different `host`.)
- **One or more profiles in the store?** → **select the target wallet** per the Credential store rules
  (named / single / `default` / ask) — then go to the Intent router. Don't silently act on the wrong wallet.
- **No profiles? Don't jump to onboarding — ASK the user first:** *"Do you already have a Treasures wallet?"*
  - **Yes** → ask them to paste **both** their **API key** (`twk_…`) **and** `wallet_id` (`wlt_…`). The
    Treasures app shows them together on the API-keys screen. ⚠️ **The key alone is NOT enough** — it's
    verified against the `wallet_id` in the URL path and there is **no key→wallet lookup endpoint**, so an
    agent given only a `twk_…` cannot discover its wallet. Validate with `GET API/wallets/:id` (confirms the
    id; the key verifies on the first quote/trade), then **ask the user to name it** and **persist the
    profile** (see Credential store → Add a wallet).
  - **No** → offer to **begin onboarding** (next bullet). On completion, **ask the user to name the wallet**
    before persisting.
- Reads-only (balances/history/portfolio) need just a `wallet_id` or addresses, not a key.
- **Onboarding REQUIRES a human and cannot be done headlessly.** The agent only **mints** the session
  and **polls** for the key; a human must open the returned `url`, log in via Privy, and grant the swap
  delegation in their browser. **If you have no way to reach a human, STOP** and surface the onboarding
  `url` with a request to complete it — do not spin or report a generic failure. See
  [`references/onboarding.md`](references/onboarding.md) for the exact loop. After onboarding the wallet
  is **empty** — it must be funded (USDC + a little native gas) before any trade.

## Intent router

| Intent | Capability | First call |
|---|---|---|
| Onboard / get a key | [Onboarding](references/onboarding.md) | `POST API/onboarding-sessions` → poll |
| Price preview | Quote | `GET API/wallets/:id/quotes` (X-API-Key, scope `quote`) |
| Buy | Trade | `POST API/wallets/:id/trades` (X-API-Key, scope `trade`) → poll |
| Sell (esp. > one cell) | **Sell playbook** (below) | `GET API/wallets/:id/balances` → quote-rank → trade per cell |
| Balances / funding | Balances | `GET API/wallets/:id/balances` (no key) |
| Trade history / P&L | History / Portfolio | `GET READS/trades`, `GET READS/portfolio` (no key) |
| Manage keys (owner) | [API keys](references/api-keys.md) | owner Privy session — agent key can't |

examples: [`references/examples.md`](references/examples.md).

## Quote — `GET API/wallets/:id/quotes`

Auth `X-API-Key` (scope `quote`). Query: `chain?`,`protocol?`,`side`,`asset`,(`notional_usdc` XOR
`shares`),`slippage_bps` (≤ 500). Omit `chain`/`protocol` to auto-route (single best cell). 200 →
`{chain,protocol,side,asset,max_amount_in,min_amount_out,route_type}` — **atomic strings** in the
input/output asset; `chain`+`protocol` echo the **resolved** cell. Advisory only — the trade re-quotes
route-first at submit.

## Buy — `POST API/wallets/:id/trades`

Auth `X-API-Key` (scope `trade`). **Headers:** `Idempotency-Key: <uuid>` (**required** — 400 if
missing), `Content-Type: application/json`. Body (`.strict()`):

```json
{ "chain":"solana", "protocol":"ondo", "side":"buy",
  "asset":"NVDA", "size":{"notional_usdc":"10"}, "slippage_bps":100 }
```

`chain`/`protocol` optional (auto-route). → **202 + job**, then poll `GET API/wallets/:id/trades/:job_id`
(**same `X-API-Key`, scope `trade`** — the poll is gated like the create). State machine:
`routing → simulating → signing → broadcast → {confirmed | failed | rejected}`.
- `confirmed` → `result = { amount_in, amount_out, tx_sig }` (atomic in/out). **EVM:** the `tx_sig`
  shown at `broadcast` is the Fusion **orderHash**; `result.tx_sig` at `confirmed` is the real
  **on-chain fill** hash.
- `failed` / `rejected` → **no funds moved**; `reject_reason` says why.

**Timing:** Solana confirms in **~2 s**; **EVM Fusion is ~20–40 s** (resolver-settled). Bound the poll
(~2 min) and treat a long-wedged `broadcast` as **unknown, not confirmed** — see Behaviors.

**Buys route the FULL notional to ONE cell — do NOT split a buy.** This mirrors B2B `planBuy`, which
quotes the full amount at each cell, keeps the best cell per chain, and executes exactly one (the
cheapest). Buys aren't holdings-constrained, so single-best-cell *is* best execution — there's no
greedy/additive buy fill (that's sell-only). A single buy is one swap on one chain and **cannot combine
cross-chain USDC**: it needs the full notional on the resolved chain, or it fails on insufficient funds.
(Only if you must deploy more USDC than sits on any single chain do you split client-side into per-chain
buys — ranked by *most shares per dollar* — but that's a deliberate cross-chain-funding case, not the default.)

## Sell playbook — single-cell, or client-side greedy split

A sell is **one signed swap from one cell**: it routes only to a cell that holds **enough to cover the
full size**. A sell larger than any single cell holds returns **`422 quote_unavailable`** — the server
does **not** split across cells (the B2B planner does; the delegated path deliberately doesn't). To
liquidate more than one cell holds, **the agent orchestrates the split** by reproducing the server's
greedy algorithm:

1. **Read holdings** — `GET API/wallets/:id/balances`; for the asset, collect each `{chain,issuer,shares}`
   position (map `sol→solana`, `eth→ethereum`; `issuer` is the `protocol`).
2. **Quote each held cell** at `min(cell.shares, remaining_target)` (pin `chain`+`protocol`).
3. **Rank by net USDC/share descending** = `min_amount_out (USDC, 6dp) / shares`. Highest rate sells first.
4. **Greedy-allocate** the target across the ranked cells, capped by each cell's holdings. If the total
   held is short of target, you can't fully fill — sell what's available or abort.
5. **Execute one single-cell `POST /trades` per leg**, **sequentially** — confirm leg N before
   committing leg N+1, so a mid-sequence failure stops cleanly and partial fills stay observable. Use a
   **fresh `Idempotency-Key` per leg**.

> **Validated example** (real mainnet, this wallet): holdings sol·ondo 0.0956, eth·xstocks 0.0472,
> eth·ondo 0.0469. Selling **0.14** ranked **sol·ondo ($205.91/sh) > eth·xstocks ($197.94) > eth·ondo
> ($192.31)** → greedy fill = leg1 sol·ondo 0.0956 (~2 s, ~$19.88) + leg2 eth·xstocks 0.0444 (~27 s,
> $8.98) → **0.14 sold for ~$28.86**, both `confirmed`, two `source='internal'` rows written.

**Dust:** selling exact share amounts leaves tiny remainders. To fully empty a cell, sell its reported
`shares` value (or document a small tolerance).

## Reads (no key)

- **Balances** — `GET API/wallets/:id/balances` → `{native,stablecoins,positions,needs_funding,as_of}`.
  On-chain truth; positions carry `shares` (human) + `raw_token` (atomic) + `notional_usd`.
- **Trade history** — `GET READS/trades?sol_wallet=&eth_wallet=&source=&limit=&offset=` (≥1 address).
  `source=all` (default) vs `internal` does **not filter** — it only toggles whether P&L columns
  (`usd_per_share`, `avg_entry_price_per_share`, `realized_pnl`) are populated. `internal` rows are the
  agent's executed trades (carry `side`/`tx_hash`/`usdc_amount`); `external` rows are on-chain transfers
  Treasures didn't execute.
- **Portfolio (P&L)** — `GET READS/portfolio?sol_wallet=&eth_wallet=&source=` → positions + `usd_value`;
  `source=internal` adds `shares_internal_only`, `avg_entry_price_per_share`, `unrealized_pnl`.

## Onboarding & API keys (summary — detail in references)

- **Onboard (agent + human, RFC 8628 device grant):** agent `POST API/onboarding-sessions` (optional
  `{api_key:{scopes,caps}}`) → `{request_id, device_secret, url, …}`; send the human the `url` (they log
  in via Privy + grant delegation in-browser); agent polls `POST API/onboarding-sessions/poll` (Bearer
  `device_secret`) until `{status:"approved", wallet, owner_email, api_key}` — **the key is delivered
  once**. See [`references/onboarding.md`](references/onboarding.md).
- **API-key management is owner-only** (Privy access+identity session — the agent's key **cannot** mint
  keys). `POST/GET/DELETE API/wallets/:id/api-keys`; scopes `['trade','quote']`; caps
  `{max_trade_notional_usd, daily_notional_usd, asset_allowlist, max_slippage_bps}`. See
  [`references/api-keys.md`](references/api-keys.md).

## Behaviors the skill MUST implement

1. **One `Idempotency-Key` per attempt.** Re-POSTing the **same** key returns the **same** job (safe to
   retry a network blip). A new attempt needs a **new** key.
2. **Retry transients with a FRESH key.** `503 routing_unavailable` (provider/RPC blip) → retry w/
   backoff. `422 quote_unavailable` (genuine no-route / thin-liquidity no-fill — eth cells can
   intermittently no-fill) → bounded retry (couple), then surface. A terminal `failed`/`rejected` (esp.
   Solana Ondo RFQ) can also be transient. All of these = **no funds moved** → retry with a **new**
   `Idempotency-Key` (old key just replays the dead job). Cap ~3 attempts. Treasures does **not**
   auto-retry server-side.
3. **Poll to terminal; bound it.** Solana ~2 s, EVM ~20–40 s. Treat `confirmed|failed|rejected` as
   terminal; otherwise keep polling up to ~2 min. **A job can wedge in `broadcast`** (e.g. a tx that
   never landed) — after the bound, treat it as **unknown** (don't assume confirmed); the server-side
   reconciler force-fails wedged jobs. Re-check `/balances` + `/trades?source=internal` for truth.
4. **Honor caps without blind-retry.** A cap breach is **403** `{error:"key_cap_exceeded", cap, reason}`
   (`asset_allowlist`, `max_slippage_bps`, `max_trade_notional_usd`, `daily_notional_usd`). Surface it;
   don't retry.
5. **Big-decimals + decimals.** Quote/job amounts are atomic; convert with the asset's decimals (USDC 6;
   reads expose `shares` vs `raw_token`). Never use floats.
6. **Gas / funding:** Solana needs SOL (fees + one-time Token-2022 ATA rent per new asset); the first
   Ethereum trade of a token needs a little ETH for a one-time ERC-20 approve (the Fusion fill is
   gasless). Surface `needs_funding` from `/balances`.
